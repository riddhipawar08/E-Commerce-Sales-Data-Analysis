# E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis
Utilizing comprehensive data cleaning and processing techniques, I transformed raw sales data into insightful visualizations. Here’s a snapshot of the E-commerce Sales Dashboard I developed, showcasing key metrics and trends:

- 📊 Order amounts and profits
- 📈 Monthly and quarterly performance
- 🌍 Profit distribution by state
- 🛒 Category and sub-category analysis

This dashboard provides actionable insights to drive business decisions and enhance sales strategies.
